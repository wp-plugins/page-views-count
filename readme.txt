== Description ==

Page Views Count does 2 things - beautifully

1. On the front end it adds an icon and page views count to the bottom of pages and posts on your WordPress website.

2. On the back end via check boxes you can apply or hide Page Views Count on all Posts, Pages and all custom posts types including WooCommerce and WP e-Commerce custom post types.  


= Why we built it =

We built this plugin and use this plugin because we think its is very good visual feedback for site users and site admins about the all time popularity and visits that day of individual posts and pages on any Wordpress website.

= Functions =

Using the 2 functions the plugin provides that allows you to manually add view counts to any content or object in your theme. This is very useful if your theme or a plugin creates content that does not use custom post type. Also useful if you want to change the position of the Page View Count from the default bottom of the page. Support for echo and return parameters when getting visitor stats on any variable.

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface = 

Like WordPress we believe that a3rev plugin users should be able to configure and tweak our plugins settings while on the go, right from their mobile or tablet. This plugins features an app style admin interface with Switches, Sliders and a smart interface that hides associated settings when a feature is not turned ON.

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.8.0 admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.5.0
* App style admin interface.
* Admin app interface is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

= Documentation & Support =

If you require support first of all please view the plugins docs on the a3rev wiki.

If the Page View Count gadget does not show on any page or post it will be because the theme you are using does not use the WordPress Codex not because the plugin does not work.
